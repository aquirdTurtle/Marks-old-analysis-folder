With this angling, the angle of both of the incoming and outgoing beams changes such that the total trap is shifted in the vertical direction. Unfortunately, this angling also changes the z-coordinate of the intercept of these beams, meaning that changing the y-position of our lattice is coupled to changing the z-position of the lattice.
